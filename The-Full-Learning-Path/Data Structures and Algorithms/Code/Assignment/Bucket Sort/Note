Bucket sort 

is a comparison sort algorithm that operates on elements by dividing them into different buckets and then sorting these buckets individually. Each bucket is sorted individually using a separate sorting algorithm like insertion sort, or by applying the bucket sort algorithm recursively.

Bucket sort is mainly useful when the input is uniformly distributed over a range. For example, imagine you have a large array of floating point integers distributed uniformly between an upper and lower bound.

You could use another sorting algorithm like merge sort, heap sort, or quick sort. However, those algorithms guarantee a best case time complexity of O(nlogn).

Using bucket sort, sorting the same array can be completed in O(n) time.
