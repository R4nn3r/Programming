# Introduction to Data Structures

Type of data structure :
    1: Linear Data Structure
    2: Non-Linear Data Structure.

        Linear Data Structure:
            Elements are arranged in one dimension ,also known as linear dimension.
            Example: lists, stack, queue, etc.

        Non-Linear Data Structure
            Elements are arranged in one-many, many-one and many-many dimensions.
            Example: tree, graph, table, etc.

# Object-Oriented Programming
    - What are the Goals, Principles and Patterns?


    [Main Concept's]
        - Class 
                : blueprint, prototype from which the objects are being created.

                class ClassName:
                    # Statement-1
                    .
                    .
                    .
                    # Statement-N

        - Objects
                : an entity that has a state and behavior associated with the class.
            -> Consists of 
                - state, identity, behavior

            [Nb]
                -The Self 
                    : first argument to be passed in Constructor and Instance Method.

        - Inheritance
                :Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class

             [Different types of Inheritance:]
                [Single] inheritance: 
                    When a child class inherits from only one parent class, it is
                    called single inheritance. We saw an example above.
                [Multiple] inheritances: 
                    When a child class inherits from multiple parent classes, 
                    it is called multiple inheritances.
                [Multilevel] Inheritance:
                    the base class and the derived class are further inherited into the new 
                    derived class. This is similar to a relationship representing a child and 
                    a grandfather. 
                [Hierarchical] Inheritance: 
                    more than one derived class are created from a single base this type of 
                    inheritance is called hierarchical inheritance
                [Hybrid] Inheritance: 

                syntax:
                    Class BaseClass:
                        {Body}
                    Class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
                        {Body}
                    Class DerivedClassTwo(DerivedClass):
                        {Body}



        - Encapsulation
        - Polymorphism
        - Data Abstraction

    
        
# Array & Hashing
    
    # Array [List]
        [Things To know]
            -> List's are mutable and tuple's are immutable
                " mutable object is an object whose state can be modified after it is defined."

                    Examples,
                        Mutable -> List, Dict, set, Custom Class
                        Immutable [easier code to debug] -> strings, tuple, frozenset([1,2,3,])

            -> Methods in List 
                -   list.append, list.extend, list.insert(i, x), 
                    list.remove, list.pop, list.clear, list.index(x [, start[, end]])
                    list.count, list.sort, list.reverse, list.copy 

        [Other sequence data types that are similar]
            -> Tuple's , tuple = (1,2,3,4,5, "cat")
            -> Set's    , set = {1,2,2} 

    # Hashing 

# Recursion

    Note:
    recursive function uses LIFO (LAST IN FIRST OUT) Structure just like the stack data structure.
    
    The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called a recursive function.


    # Properties
        - same operation multiple times
        - smaller inputs to make the problem smaller
        - Base condition is needed to stop the recursion


    # How are problems solved with recursion
        idea is to represent a problem in terms of one or more smaller problems, and add one or more base conditions that stop the recursion.

    # Overflow error
        Stack overflow error occurs in recursions when the base case is not reached or not defined!


    # Types of Recursions

        # Direct
            Calls its self.

        # Indirectly
            Calls another function

            Ex.
                void indirectRecFun1()
                {
                    // Some code...

                    indirectRecFun2();

                    // Some code...
                }
                void indirectRecFun2()
                {
                    // Some code...

                    indirectRecFun1();

                    // Some code...
                }

        # Tailed vs Non-tailed
            when the recursive call is the last thing executed by the function

    # Problems of recursive functions

        - greater space requirement
        - greater time requirement
        - difficult code to understand


    # Summary of Recursion:
            #   There are two types of cases in recursion i.e. recursive
                case and a base case.

            #   The base case is used to terminate the recursive
                function when the case turns out to be true.

            #   Each recursive call makes a new copy of that method in
                the stack memory.

            #   Infinite recursion may lead to running out of stack memory.

                Examples of Recursive algorithms:
                Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Tower of Hanoi, Fibonacci Series, Factorial Problem, etc.
