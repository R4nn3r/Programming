# Recursion

    Note:
    recursive function uses LIFO (LAST IN FIRST OUT) Structure just like the stack data structure.
    
    The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called a recursive function.


    # Properties
        - same operation multiple times
        - smaller inputs to make the problem smaller
        - Base condition is needed to stop the recursion


    # How are problems solved with recursion
        idea is to represent a problem in terms of one or more smaller problems, and add one or more base conditions that stop the recursion.

    # Overflow error
        Stack overflow error occurs in recursions when the base case is not reached or not defined!


    # Types of Recursions

        # Direct
            Calls its self.

        # Indirectly
            Calls another function

            Ex.
                void indirectRecFun1()
                {
                    // Some code...

                    indirectRecFun2();

                    // Some code...
                }
                void indirectRecFun2()
                {
                    // Some code...

                    indirectRecFun1();

                    // Some code...
                }

        # Tailed vs Non-tailed
            when the recursive call is the last thing executed by the function

    # Problems of recursive functions

        - greater space requirement
        - greater time requirement
        - difficult code to understand


    # Summary of Recursion:
            #   There are two types of cases in recursion i.e. recursive
                case and a base case.

            #   The base case is used to terminate the recursive
                function when the case turns out to be true.

            #   Each recursive call makes a new copy of that method in
                the stack memory.

            #   Infinite recursion may lead to running out of stack memory.

                Examples of Recursive algorithms:
                Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Tower of Hanoi, Fibonacci Series, Factorial Problem, etc.
