# Introduction to Data Structures

Type of data structure :
    1: Linear Data Structure
    2: Non-Linear Data Structure.

        Linear Data Structure:
            Elements are arranged in one dimension ,also known as linear dimension.
            Example: lists, stack, queue, etc.

        Non-Linear Data Structure
            Elements are arranged in one-many, many-one and many-many dimensions.
            Example: tree, graph, table, etc.
