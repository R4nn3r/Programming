# Creating a Project in Django

    django-admin startproject learning_log . (project name)

        Note:
            The command at u tells Django to set up a new project called learning
            _log. The dot at the end of the command creates the new project with a
            directory structure that will make it easy to deploy the app to a server when
            weâ€™re finished developing it.

# Creating the Database

    python manage.py migrate


# Viewing the Project

    python manage.py runserver



# Example Project set-up
