        <h2>Lucius Annaeus Seneca</h2>
        <p>
          Lucius Annaeus Seneca the Younger, usually known as Seneca, was a
          Roman Stoic philosopher, statesman, dramatist, and, in one work,
          satirist, from the post-Augustan age of Latin literature. Seneca was
          born in CÃ³rdoba in Hispania, and raised in Rome, where he was trained
          in rhetoric and philosophy.
