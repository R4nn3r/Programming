          <p>
            While Spot was learning to play fetch and Rover was rescuing people
            stuck in wells, Daniel “Bark” Zhang was building the world's first
            smartphone for dogs. The iPup is a paw-friendly mobile tablet
            running Android “Beefcake”. Daniel says (through a dog translator)
            that the idea struck him while peeing on a tree.

          <h3 class="title">A secret balloon store in downtown Toronto</h3>
          <p>
            It's a quiet, unassuming building, with venetian blinds and spanish
            masonry. Only the sharpest observer would notice the occasional
            flash of colour from beyond the curtain, a glint of red and yellow
            inflatables. Alabaster's Balloonery is possibly the country's most
            understated party store, but outside appearances can be deceiving.
            Though its red-brick facade has been left unchanged since it was
            erected over 50 years ago, the interior has been renovated, bringing
            a postmodern flourish that complements the colourful party supplies
            quite nicely.

            If sitting is the new smoking, then standing desks are the new
            nicotine patches. But most standing desks cost an arm and a leg.

        <span>L</span>orem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and
        typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy
        text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
        and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
        electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
        popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
        Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software
        like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
      </p>
      <p>
        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It
        has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it
        over 2000 years old.
      </p>
      <p>
        Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in
        Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur,
        from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in
        classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus
        Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written
        in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular
        during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum
        dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
