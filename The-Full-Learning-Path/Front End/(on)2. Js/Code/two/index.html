          <p>
            While Spot was learning to play fetch and Rover was rescuing people
            stuck in wells, Daniel “Bark” Zhang was building the world's first
            smartphone for dogs. The iPup is a paw-friendly mobile tablet
            running Android “Beefcake”. Daniel says (through a dog translator)
            that the idea struck him while peeing on a tree.

          <h3 class="title">A secret balloon store in downtown Toronto</h3>
          <p>
            It's a quiet, unassuming building, with venetian blinds and spanish
            masonry. Only the sharpest observer would notice the occasional
            flash of colour from beyond the curtain, a glint of red and yellow
            inflatables. Alabaster's Balloonery is possibly the country's most
            understated party store, but outside appearances can be deceiving.
            Though its red-brick facade has been left unchanged since it was
            erected over 50 years ago, the interior has been renovated, bringing
            a postmodern flourish that complements the colourful party supplies
            quite nicely.

            The $20 standing desk physiotherapists are obsessed with
          </h3>
          <p>
            If sitting is the new smoking, then standing desks are the new
            nicotine patches. But most standing desks cost an arm and a leg.
