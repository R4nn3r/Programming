          <h3>Lucius Annaeus Seneca</h3>
          <p>
            Lucius Annaeus Seneca the Younger, usually known as Seneca, was a
            Roman Stoic philosopher, statesman, dramatist, and, in one work,
            satirist, from the post-Augustan age of Latin literature. Seneca was
            born in CÃ³rdoba in Hispania, and raised in Rome, where he was
            trained in rhetoric and philosophy.
