JS
    JavaScript was introduced in 1995 as a way to add programs to web pages in the
    Netscape Navigator browser. The language has since been adopted by all other
    major graphical web browsers. It has made modern web applications possibleâ€”
    applications with which you can interact directly without doing a page reload
    for every action. JavaScript is also used in more traditional websites to provide
    various forms of interactivity and cleverness.

# querySelector 

    The querySelector() method returns the first element that matches a CSS selector.
    To return all matches (not only the first), use the querySelectorAll() instead.
    Both querySelector() and querySelectorAll() 
        Note 
            throw a SYNTAX_ERR exception if the selector(s) is invalid.
