    <!-- -> Commenting --> 

# Basic HTML

        Headers                 (<h1></h1> -> upto <h6></h6> where they get smaller in size)
        Links                   ( <link rel="stylesheet" href="#"> )
                                ( <a href="Google.com" target="_blank">Googel</a> )
                                        -> attribute = name
        Paragraphs              ( <p>This is where you write your Paragraphs </p> )
        Images                  ( <img src="source link" alt="info about image"> )
        Inputs                  ( <input type="[text,checkbox,radio]" name="" value="" placeholder="">)
        Div Container :         <div>  s allow us to group elements together and create 
                                more complex layouts. 
                    <div class="container">
                        ... (maybe other multiple Div's)
                    </div>

    -> The HTML Structure 
                <!DOCTYPE html>     Tells the browser to use a modern version of HTML. 
                <html> 
                    <head> 
                    ... 
                    </head>         <head>  contains everything that's  not visible  like  the 
                                title and description(a.k.a. metadata) as well as links to fonts 
                                and CSS stylesheets. 
                    <body> 
                    ... 
                    </body>         <body>  contains everything that's  visible  like buttons,  text, images, etc. 
                </html> 


    # Advanced HTML
            Semantic elements: (Are elements that clearly explain there content)
                Headers         <header></header>
                Nav             <nav></nav>
                Main            <main></main>
                Section         <section></section>
                
                Ex.
                    <article>, <aside>, <details>, <figcaption>, <figure>, <footer>
                    <mark>, <summary>, <time>

        # Button
            <button type="button"> Click </button>

# Basic Css 

    -> link with your Html file with:
                        <link rel="stylesheet" href="example.css">
                    
    Selectors:
            elements        -> ( div {...})
            class           -> (.class_name {...})
            id              -> (#id_tag {...})
    
    # Advanced Css Selectors 


    Box Model:
        1. Margin = space on the outside    
                        Ex.
                            margin: 10px; (all around)
                            margin: 10px 10px; (top/bottom and left/right)
                            margin: top, right, bottom, left] 
        2. Padding = space on the inside   
                        Ex.
                            Same as margin but inside :)
        3. Border              
                        Ex.
                        border-width:  1px;   Sets the border width. 
                        border-style:  solid;   Sets the border style (to a solid color). 
                        border-color:  red;   Sets the border color. 
                                or
                        border:  width style color; 
                        border:  1px  solid red  ; 
                      
# Tips For Layouts

    To Create the Vertical Layouts 
        ●  Use  <div>'s with  display  :  block  (most common) 
        ●  Use flexbox with  flex-direction  :  column 
        ●  Use CSS grid  with 1 column 

    To Create the Horizontal Layouts 
        ●  Use  <div>'s with  display  :  inline-block  (not recommended) 
        ●  Use flexbox with  flex-direction  :  row 
        ●  Use CSS grid with multiple columns 

# Type of elements
    Block elements                          -> They take the whole line
    Inline-Block elements                   -> only takes space they need
    Inline
