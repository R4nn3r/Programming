                    <p>According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first known use of computer was 
                        in a 1613 book called The Yong Mans Gleanings by the English writer Richard 
                        Brathwait:This usage of the term referred to a human computer, a person who carried
                        out calculations or computations. The word continued with the same meaning until the 
                        middle of the 20th century. During the latter part of this period women were often 
                        hired as computers because they could be paid less than their male counterparts.
                        By 1943, most human computers were women.

                   <p>Charles Babbage, an English mechanical engineer and polymath, originated the 
                    concept of a programmable computer. Considered the "father of the computer",
                     he conceptualized and invented the first mechanical computer in the early 19th
                      century. After working on his revolutionary difference engine, designed to aid 
                      in navigational calculations, in 1833 he realized that a much more general design, an Analytical Engine, was possible. </p>
