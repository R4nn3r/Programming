                <p>This project-based tutorial series will introduce you to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), a stylesheet language used to control the presentation of websites, by building a personal website using our <a href="http://css.sammy-codes.com/">demonstration site</a> as a model. Though our demonstration site features Sammy the Shark, you can switch out Sammy’s information with your own if you wish to personalize your site.</p>
                <p>Alongside HTML and JavaScript, CSS is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. If you have some understanding of HTML and are looking to grow your front-end development skills, learning CSS is a great next step.</p>
                <p>The first half of this tutorial series will introduce CSS through hands-on exercises and the second half of the tutorial series will provide steps for recreating the demonstration website. If you want to start building the demonstration website right away, you can start with the tutorial <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-your-css-and-html-website-project">How To Set Up Your CSS and HTML Website Project</a> and proceed from there.</p>
                <p>By the end of this CSS tutorial series, you will have files ready for deploying a website to the cloud, as well as an understanding of how to continue modifying the site’s design with HTML and CSS. You will also have a foundation for learning additional front-end web development skills (such as <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tags/javascript">JavaScript</a>) and frameworks (like <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/build-a-beautiful-landing-page-with-tailwind-css">Tailwind</a>).</p>

            <div class="card-content"><h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
                <p>This project-based tutorial series will introduce you to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), a stylesheet language used to control the presentation of websites, by building a personal website using our <a href="http://css.sammy-codes.com/">demonstration site</a> as a model. Though our demonstration site features Sammy the Shark, you can switch out Sammy’s information with your own if you wish to personalize your site.</p>
                <p>Alongside HTML and JavaScript, CSS is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. If you have some understanding of HTML and are looking to grow your front-end development skills, learning CSS is a great next step.</p>
                <p>The first half of this tutorial series will introduce CSS through hands-on exercises and the second half of the tutorial series will provide steps for recreating the demonstration website. If you want to start building the demonstration website right away, you can start with the tutorial <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-your-css-and-html-website-project">How To Set Up Your CSS and HTML Website Project</a> and proceed from there.</p>
                <p>By the end of this CSS tutorial series, you will have files ready for deploying a website to the cloud, as well as an understanding of how to continue modifying the site’s design with HTML and CSS. You will also have a foundation for learning additional front-end web development skills (such as <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tags/javascript">JavaScript</a>) and frameworks (like <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/build-a-beautiful-landing-page-with-tailwind-css">Tailwind</a>).</p>
