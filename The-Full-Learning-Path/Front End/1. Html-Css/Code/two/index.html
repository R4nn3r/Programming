                <p>Ethiopia, is a landlocked country in the Horn of Africa. It shares borders with 
                    Eritrea to the north, Djibouti to the northeast, Somalia to the east and northeast,
                    Kenya to the south, South Sudan to the west, and Sudan to the northwest.
                    Ethiopia has a total area of 1,100,000 square kilometres (420,000 sq mi). As of 2022, 
                    it is home to around 123.5 million inhabitants, making it the 12th-most populous country in 
                    the world and the 2nd-most populous in Africa after Nigeria.
                </p>
                <p>Anatomically modern humans emerged from modern-day Ethiopia and set out to the Near East and elsewhere 
                    in the Middle Paleolithic period.Southwestern Ethiopia has been proposed as a possible homeland of the Afroasiatic language family.
                    Christianity was embraced by the kingdom in 330, and Islam arrived by the first Hijra in 615. After the collapse of Aksum in 960, a variety of kingdoms, largely tribal confederations, existed in the land of Ethiopia. 
                </p>
                <p>Ethiopia is a multi-ethnic state with over 80 different ethnic groups. Christianity and Islam are the main faiths observed in Ethiopia. This sovereign state is a founding member of the UN, the Group of 24, the Non-Aligned Movement, the Group of 77, and the Organisation of African Unity. Addis Ababa is the headquarters of the African Union, the Pan African Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, the African Standby Force and many of the global non-governmental organizations focused on Africa. Ethiopia is considered an emerging power
                    and developing country, having the fastest economic growth in Sub-Saharan African countries because of foreign direct investment in expansion of agricultural and manufacturing industries.

                <p>The Greek name Αἰθιοπία (from Αἰθίοψ, Aithiops, "an Ethiopian") is a compound word, derived from the two Greek words, from αἴθω + ὤψ (aithō "I burn" + ōps "face"). According to the Liddell-Scott Jones Greek-English Lexicon, the designation properly translates as burnt-face in noun form and red-brown in adjectival form.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>In the Ge'ez version of the Ezana inscription, Aἰθίοπες is equated with the unvocalized Ḥbšt and Ḥbśt (Ḥabashat), and denotes for the first time the highland inhabitants of Aksum. This new demonym was subsequently rendered as ḥbs ('Aḥbāsh) in Sabaic and as Ḥabasha in Arabic.
                    </p>
                </li>
                </ul>
                <p>In English, and generally outside of Ethiopia, the country was historically known as Abyssinia. This toponym was derived from the Latinized form of the ancient Habash.

                <p>This project-based tutorial series will introduce you to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), a stylesheet language used to control the presentation of websites, by building a personal website using our <a href="http://css.sammy-codes.com/">demonstration site</a> as a model. Though our demonstration site features Sammy the Shark, you can switch out Sammy’s information with your own if you wish to personalize your site.</p>
                <p>Alongside HTML and JavaScript, CSS is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. If you have some understanding of HTML and are looking to grow your front-end development skills, learning CSS is a great next step.</p>
                <p>The first half of this tutorial series will introduce CSS through hands-on exercises and the second half of the tutorial series will provide steps for recreating the demonstration website.

                <p>By the end of this CSS tutorial series, you will have files ready for deploying a website to the cloud, as well as an understanding of how to continue modifying the site’s design with HTML and CSS. You will also have a foundation for learning additional front-end web development skills (such as <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tags/javascript">JavaScript</a>) and frameworks (like <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/build-a-beautiful-landing-page-with-tailwind-css">Tailwind</a>).</p>

                <p>This project-based tutorial series will introduce you to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), a stylesheet language used to control the presentation of websites, by building a personal website using our <a href="http://css.sammy-codes.com/">demonstration site</a> as a model. Though our demonstration site features Sammy the Shark, you can switch out Sammy’s information with your own if you wish to personalize your site.</p>
                <p>Alongside HTML and JavaScript, CSS is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. If you have some understanding of HTML and are looking to grow your front-end development skills, learning CSS is a great next step.</p>
                <p>The first half of this tutorial series will introduce CSS through hands-on exercises and the second half of the tutorial series will provide steps for recreating the demonstration website. If you want to start building the demonstration website right away, you can start with the tutorial <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-your-css-and-html-website-project">How To Set Up Your CSS and HTML Website Project</a> and proceed from there.</p>
                <p>By the end of this CSS tutorial series, you will have files ready for deploying a website to the cloud, as well as an understanding of how to continue modifying the site’s design with HTML and CSS. You will also have a foundation for learning additional front-end web development skills (such as <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tags/javascript">JavaScript</a>) and frameworks (like <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/build-a-beautiful-landing-page-with-tailwind-css">Tailwind</a>).</p>
