# Major Rule's 
    1, Flex box for single dimension layout (row, column)
    2. Grid for multiple dimension layouts ( row and column together)

#  Rendering Logic [!Important] *****

    # Inheritance 
        Core Concept:
            When you set a property for a parent mostly the children of that parent will get to
            inherit those properties.
           
           # font-* properties are inherited

            properties such as height, width, border, margin, padding, etc. are not inherited.
           
                Note: 
                Form elements don;t follow the inheritance rule by default.
                "inherit" keyword allows authors to explicitly specify inheritance. 
                It works on both inherited and non-inherited properties.

    # The Cascade 
            The cascading algorithm determines how to find the value to apply
            for each property for each document element.

            Thus steps followed by the algo,
                - Relevance
                - Origin and importance
                - Specificity
                - Order of appearance 
            

            Note: 
                Transitions and animations
                    Property values set by animation @keyframes are more important than all 
                    normal styles (those with no !important set).
                    Property values being set in a transition take precedence over all other
                    values set, even those marked with !important.

    # Width Algorithms 
         How elements react to the width algorithm is highly dependent on the type of element they are:
            block elements have dynamic sizing (they are context aware) because they have 
            a width of auto they grow as much as there able to.

        # Keyword values 
            - Measurements (100%, px, rem)
            - Keywords (auto, fit-content, min/max-content)   

                Note: when values are set by;
                    parent: extrinsic

                    child: intrinsic 

            - min\max-Width
    
    # Height Algorithms
        [bad to tinker with so just DON'T!]
        
    # The Box Model

        The fours aspects the make up the box model Are:
            - content
            - padding [innerSpace]
            - border
                border vs outline 
                    -> outline doesn’t affect the layout like [box-shadow]
            - margin [outerSpace]
                -> margins can have negative values they will pull the elements outside of there
                parents

                -> Note: margin-inline: auto [sets element to the center]
                    but:
                        only works for horizontal margin 
                        only works with elements with explicit width

        # Note :
            [Box Sizing]
                box-sizing by default has the property set to content-box and that will led to 
                the page take only the content of elements into account when deciding there size
                so we always make sure to set box-sizing to [border-box]

                 Ex.
                 /* Box sizing rules */
                    *,
                    *::before,
                    *::after {
                        box-sizing: border-box;
                    }

        # Margin collapses
                When two block-level elements are adjacent or nested, their margins can overlap, or be absorbed.
                
            -> Rules of margin collapse 
                - margins only collapse in flow layouts 
                - only adjacent elements collapse 
                - the bigger margin wins 
                - nesting doesn't prevent collapsing 
                - margins can collapse in the same direction 
            
        

                    



        # Border Properties 
            - border width
            - border style [solid, dotted]
            - border color

    # The Flow Layout   
        -> Flow is the default layout mode;; every element will use a display value of either
        inline, block or inline-block and the default values depend on the tag!


        - Note:
            1, inline -elements always go with the flow with some exceptions given to what we 
            call [replaced elements] ex, img, video, canvas and buttons(tho not replaced)
            2, the browsers sees inline elements as text so they have [magic place: are a bit larger then the value you set cause text in a browser has space around it ]
                solution:
                    display: block [images, videos to have the correct size]
                    line-height: 0 -> to the wrapping div

            Tip [inline Elements ot manipulate text inside a box]:

                box-decoration-break takes two different values:
                    slice (default)
                    clone

   # Position's 
    
        # Types of Position's
                # Static (default)

                # Relative 
                    (look at this as an anchor everything below 
                    this will be positioned relative to the element that has position: "relative" )

                    and also unlocks properties such as:
                        top, left, right, bottom

                # absolute (relative to the parent or the body by default) [takes an element out of the original flow] 
                    removes the element from the normal flow of the page 

                    NOTE:
                        The main difference between relative and absolute positioning 
                        is that position: absolute will take a child element completely 
                        out of the normal flow of the document. And that child will 
                        be positioned in relation to the first parent element that has 
                        its own position set.


                            position: absolute;
                            top: 0%;
                            bottom: 0%;
                            left: 0%;
                            right: 0%;

                # Fixed 
                    remove from normal flow -> place it in the same place in the viewport

                        Tip:    A fixed element must have a top or bottom position set. 
                                If it doesn’t, it will simply not exist on the page at all.

                # sticky 
                    act like relative elements but on scroll change to fixed elements 

        # Stacking Contexts

                -> How elements get stacked is determined by the layout manager

                    - Flow Layout
                        ->  Nothing stacks but if forced with a negative margins then
                            the DOM order matters 
            
            # Creating stacking context 
                -> give the element a position[!static] and z-index[!negative]
                -> The isolation property - isolation: isolate; [creates a stack context]

            # General Rule's 
                - positioned elements will always render on top of non-positioned ones.
                
                    summarize:

                    - When all siblings are rendered in Flow layout, the DOM order controls how the background elements overlap, but the content will always float to the front.

                    - If one sibling uses positioned layout, it will appear above its non-positioned sibling, no matter what the DOM order is.

                    - If both siblings use positioned layout, the DOM order controls which element will be on top. Unlike in Flow layout, the content does not float to the front.

            # z-index [ only works with positioned elements* -> but it does in Flexbox (as well as Grid].
                -> Never use negative z-index values!!!

                -> Managing z-index
                    - make sure you just don't throw z-index at every problem you face
                    check for the DOM order is another way to solve stacking problems before 
                    trying out z-index


                    Note: Be careful with swapping the DOM order to control rendering should be done 
                    on elements that are not interactive for cases where users interact with keyboard 

        # Overflow 
            [x-y]
                -> auto [recommended]
                -> visible
                -> hidden 
                -> scroll

            - Horizontal overflow

                white-space is a property that lets us tweak how words and other inline/inline-block elements wrap. By setting it to nowrap, we instruct the container to never break lines. That, in tandem with overflow: auto, allows us to achieve a horizontally-scrollable element.

        # Tips:
         Center an element using position absolute 

            There are 4 important ingredients for this trick to work:
                absolute positioning (position: absolute)
                Equal distances from each edge (ideally 0px)
                A fixed size (defined width and height properties)
                Hungry margins (margin: auto)

                .box {
                    position: absolute;
                    top: 0px;
                    left: 0px;
                    right: 0px;

                    bottom: 0px;
                    width: 100px;
                    height: 100px;
                    margin: auto;
                    background: green;
                }

    - Dealing with the box model

            Tip:
                *,
                *::before,
                ::after {
                    box-sizing: border-box;
                }

            This means the padding and margin will be consider with the properties
            that set your height and width 

    - Specificity
            If there are two or more CSS rules that point to the same element, the 
            selector with the highest specificity value will "win", and its style 
            declaration will be applied to that HTML element.


        # There are four categories which define the specificity level of a selector:

            Inline styles - Example: <h1 style="color: pink;">
            IDs - Example: #navbar
            Classes, pseudo-classes, attribute selectors - Example: .test, :hover, [href]
            Elements and pseudo-elements - Example: h1, :before

    - Naming stuff

            Make sure the name's are 
                - Meaningful names

# Ways to make any page's responsive
        Note: Every page is responsive from the start your breaking the page so you can solve it! thats the mind set you need to have.
    
    - Always start with a [Global] styling! 
    - Avoid fixed sizes 
    - Use media queries to add complexity
    - Take advantage of modern css

# Accessibility 
    - Ensure your site 
    - Use high contrast colors 
    - Provide Alt text for images 
    - Use heading hierarchies 
    - Add captions and transcripts to videos 
    - Design forms carefully 
    - add aria-label
            <button aria-label="Contact support">
                <HelpCircle />
            </button>
        or use

        .visually-hidden {
            position: absolute;
            overflow: hidden;
            clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
            height: 1px;
            width: 1px;
            margin: -1px;
            padding: 0;
            border: 0;
        }
            -> and wrap content you want to hide visually but make it readable for 
            screen readers as well

# How to write semantically good html?

    - Text content
        - use proper heading and paragraph tags 
    
    - Using clear language 
        - Don't use dashes 
        - Expand abbreviations 
        - Expand acronyms at least once or twice, then use the <abbr> tag to describe them. 
   
    - Page layout 
            <header>
                <h1>Header</h1>
            </header>

            <nav>

# Css layouts Secret!

    - Relationship between parent and child?
        Tip: 
            - let the children dictate the height of the parent!
            - and children's width should be auto 

    - How child's margin impacts the parent 
    
    - Flex and grid impacts on the relationship of elements 
        Gird:
            The parent has more control on the children cause 
            your setting up a layout and the children live within that layout 

        Flex:
            The children affect the parent as well as there siblings 

# Best Practice to follow to get a better grip on the industry.

    # Optimization of the web site using npm packages
        - npm init 
        - npm install postcss postcss-cli autoprefixer cssnano postcss-pxtorem --save-dev
        - Write the script 
            "scripts": {
                    "optimize-css":"postcss style.css --use autoprefixer cssnano postcss-pxtorem --output style.prod.css --no-map"

    # Making a website start to finish 

        1: Have a good look at the design and try to figure out on some routes to can take
           from 
                - how you can structure the html to how you can style the page 
                - what can be generalized and used in common
                - how to use the media query to make the site responsive 
                - and complication you may have going through writing the code 
                - decide on how you can abstract more of your properties
        2: npm create vite@latest
            chose the options as needed
                cd to the directory
                    npm install

                    npm run dev
                        -> to run local host

        3: Before staring you need to rest the default css styles 

                -> https://gist.github.com/Asjas/4b0736108d56197fce0ec9068145b421


                tip: Change this from what ever it was before 
                        /* Remove default margin */
                        * {
                            margin: 0;
                            padding: 0;
                            font: inherit;  -> (makes you style every element from the class)
                        }
                tip:
                    add
                    scroll-behavior: smooth;

        4:  Create custom set ups for the variable on :root sot it gets easier to
            use for responsiveness and it does look better 

                - Create utility classes  
                    -> make sure your utility list has low specificity 

        5: Create the Html structure 

        6: General styling 
            - For Svg 
                https://svgsprit.es/

                    make a general.svg
                        - paste the sprit on it 
                          and use that to import svg on the site 
                          its better then just using and img 
            - For sticky navbar's 
                scroll-padding-top: 2em;
                    So that the content doesn't slide under the navbar

        7: Make sure to use semantic elements

            <html lang="en">
                <head>
                    <title>Hello</title>
                </head>
                <body>
                    <header>This is the header</header>
                    <nav>This is the nav</nav>
                    <main>This is the main</main>
                    <footer>This is the footer</footer>
                </body>
            </html>

            <html lang="en">
            <head>
                    <title>Hello</title>
                </head>
                <body>
                    <div role="banner">This is the header</div>
                    <div role="navigation">This is the nav</div>
                    <div role="main">This is the main</div>
                    <div role="contentinfo">This is the footer</div>
                </body>
            </html>

            works based on the root font size 
            if root font-size: 16px;
                    1rem = 16px


        # Overly complicated selectors 
            
        # Readable css 

        # Organized Css 
            - Group similar types
            - Comment code 

        # Refractor your code 
            Tip: remember
                - inheritance
                - group styles that are the same!
                    - group selectors at the top!

        # Don't remove outlines [a must for accessibility]
            -> if you do style focus states!

        # Text contrast must not be too low 

# Sass , Bem

    # Sass Partials 
        Creating partitions for the styles based on there structure
            Ex.
                Header  ->      _header.scss
                Hero    ->      _hero.scss
                Footer  ->      _footer.scss   

        
        For bigger projects you can even partition based on type of element 
            Ex,

                Typography   ->   _typography.scss
                Reset   -> _reset.scss


        Then create load them on main sass file called index 
            Ex.
                globals (folder)
                    _index.scss 
                        @forward "reset"
                        @forward "typography"
                

                Main style scss 
                    style.scss
                        @forward "globals"

    # Creating variables
    
        (CSS)
        # Root

            :root {
                --ff-primary: monospace;
                --txt-crl: blue;
            }

            to use the variables 
                -> var(--txt-crl)

        (SASS)

            $ff-primary: monospace;
            $txt-crl: blue;

                to use the variables 
                    -> $txt-crl

    # Using custom modules 
        Create a folder that contain the style 
        and import whole folder as a module

            Ex. 
                utility
                    _fonts.scss
                        $font-color: blue;

                    _colors.scss
                
                To import 
                    @use "location of utility" as util;

                            -> as util (is a namespace)
                            -> you can use a wildcard 
                                @use "location of utility" as *
                                    
                                    color: @font-color
                    
                    color: util.@font-color

    # Using BEM (Block, Element, Modifier methodology)

        BEM is a front-end naming method for organizing and naming CSS classes.
            Block:
                which holds everything (elements) inside and acts as a scope.

            Element:
                which acts as a specific part of the component.

            Modifier:
                which adds additional styles to a specific element(s).

            
            Ex.
                (html)

                    <div class="head">
                        <div class="head__eye head__eye--left">(o)</div>
                        <div class="head__eye head__eye--right">(o)</div>
                    </div>

                (scss)

                    .head { -> block
                        &__eye { -> element

                            &--left{ -> modifier

                            }
                            &--right{
                                
                            }
                        }
                    }

            --green-500: red;
            --green-300: tomato;
            --radio: hsl(167, 92%, 14%);
        }

# Theme Tip: 

        :root {
            --hue: 270deg;  [you can add another value for the saturation --hue-sat: 270deg 20%]
            --color-gray-100: hsl(var(--hue) 20% 95%);
            --color-gray-300: hsl(var(--hue) 10% 75%);
            --color-gray-500: hsl(var(--hue) 5% 50%);
            --color-gray-700: hsl(var(--hue) 10% 30%);
            --color-gray-900: hsl(var(--hue) 15% 15%);
        }

# The Magic of calc and Clamp 

    ->  Both are [VALUES] so they can be used with 
        every property that takes is numeric values 

    # Calc
        : calc takes in a value and puts out its calculated version plus you can mix units 
            max-width: 100px;
            width: calc(50% + 32px) // output: 82px

        We can use 4 mathematical operators:
            + (addition)
            - (subtraction)
            * (multiplication)
            / (division)

        
        Tip: you can use calc for unit conversion 
            -> font-size: calc(14 / 16 * 1rem)

    # Clamp 
        
        : takes 3 values 
            - min value (min-width)
            - ideal value (width) 
            - max value (max-width)
        
        
            font-size: clamp(28px, 16px+0.5vw, 40px)
                            min    preferred   max 

    # min / max 
        .box {
            padding: min(32px, 5vw);
        } [or you can use max in similar fashion]


    Tip: [how to make picture responsive]
           ->  max-width: min(28rem, 100%)

        Div Container :         <div>  s allow us to group elements together and create 
                                more complex layouts. 
                    <div class="container">

    # Advanced HTML
            Semantic elements: (Are elements that clearly explain there content)
                Headers         <header></header>
                Nav             <nav></nav>
                Main            <main></main>
                Section         <section></section>
                
                Ex.
                    <article>, <aside>, <details>, <figcaption>, <figure>, <footer>
                    <mark>, <summary>, <time>


                    Note:
    
                           <article> is a sectioning element and is used to wrap independent, self-contained content. 
                           The tag works well with blog entries, forum posts, or news articles.

                           <section> is for grouping thematically related content. They can be used within each other, as 
                           needed. For example, if a book is the article, then each chapter is a section. When there's no 
                           relationship between groups of content, then use a <div>.
                        - So,

                            <div> - groups content 
                            <section> - groups related content 
                            <article> - groups independent, self-contained content
                            <header> -  wrap introductory information or navigation links for 
                                        its parent tag and works well for repeated content at the top on multiple 
                                        pages.
                    
                            <figure> element and the related <figcaption>. Used together, these items wrap a 
                                    visual representation (like an image, diagram, or chart) along with its caption. 
                                    Wrapping these elements together gives a two-fold accessibility boost by semantically 
                                    grouping related content and providing a text alternative explaining the figure

                - Field-set and legends 
                        Ex. 
                            <form>
                                <fieldset>
                                    <legend>Choose one of these three items:</legend>
                                    <input id="one" type="radio" name="items" value="one">
                                    <label for="one">Choice One</label><br>
                                    <input id="two" type="radio" name="items" value="two">
                                    <label for="two">Choice Two</label><br>
                                    <input id="three" type="radio" name="items" value="three">
                                    <label for="three">Choice Three</label>
                                </fieldset>
                            </form>
                            
                - Date Picker

                        <label for="pickdate">Preferred Date:</label>
                        <input type="date" id="pickdate" name="date">

            -> refer to the image or google for the table

            - multiple element selectors
                a, b, c
            - descendant selectors
                a b 
            - child selectors
                a > b
            - adjacent sibling selectors
                a + b
            - attribute selectors
                [a=b]
            - pseudo class selectors 
                a:b
            - pseudo element selectors
                a::b
    Box Model:
        1. Margin = space on the outside    
                        Ex.
                            margin: 10px; (all around)
                            margin: 10px 10px; (top/bottom and left/right)
                            margin: top, right, bottom, left] 
        2. Padding = space on the inside   
                        Ex.
                            Same as margin but inside :)
        3. Border              
                        Ex.
                        border-width:  1px;   Sets the border width. 
                        border-style:  solid;   Sets the border style (to a solid color). 
                        border-color:  red;   Sets the border color. 
                                or
                        border:  width style color; 
                        border:  1px  solid red  ; 

        
    Using root to set variables (helps with Responsive in @media)
                :root {
                    --penguin-size: 300px;
                    --penguin-skin: gray;
                    --penguin-belly: white;
                    --penguin-beak: orange;
                }
           
           
                @media (max-width: 350px) {
                    :root {
                        --penguin-size: 200px;
                        --penguin-skin: black;
                    }
                }

# colors 
    - HEX codes  [mostly used]
        #ffffff -> white
        -> every 2 values representation of the colors 
            [red, green, blue]

    - keywords  [while learning not for work cases]
        red, green, lime , ,,,

    - RGB
        rgb(red, green, blue, opacity)

    - HSL [Best one to use]
        hsl(hue(deg), saturation, lightness, opacity)

# Applied Visual Design

    - text-align property.

            text-align: justify; spaces the text so that each line has equal width.

            text-align: center; centers the text

            text-align: right; right-aligns the text

            And text-align: left; (the default) left-aligns the text.

    - Tags
            underline  
            strong 
            italic
            emphasis 
            strike-through
            HorizontalLine 

     - Box-shadow 
            property takes the following values, in order:

                offset-x (how far to push the shadow horizontally from the element)
                offset-y (how far to push the shadow vertically from the element)
                blur-radius
                spread-radius
                color

    - text-transform values change the example text "Transform me".

                Value	                    Result

                lowercase	                "transform me"
                uppercase	                "TRANSFORM ME"
                capitalize	                "Transform Me"
                initial	                    Use the default value
                inherit	                    Use the text-transform value from the parent element
                none	                    Default: Use the original text


    - Line-height

    - Relative Position

            it allows you to specify how CSS should move it relative to its current position 
            in the normal flow of the page. It pairs with the CSS offset properties of left 
            or right, and top or bottom    

    - Absolute Positioning (Lock an Element to its Parent)
                Note: this removes the element from the normal flow of the document, 
                so surrounding items ignore it. 

            You declare position relative on the element you want to lock the position with
            then declare position absolute on the element to be positioned 

    - Fixed Positioning (Lock an Element to the Browser Window)

            Note: One key difference between the fixed and absolute positions is that an 
            element with a fixed position won't move when the user scrolls.


    - Float Property

            Floating elements are removed from the normal flow of a document and pushed to 
            either the left or right of their containing parent element. It's commonly used 
            with the width property to specify how much horizontal space the floated element 
            requires.

    - z-index Property

            property can specify the order of how elements are stacked on top of one another. 
            It must be an integer (i.e. a whole number and not a decimal), and higher values 
            for the z-index property of an element move it higher in the stack than those with
            lower values.


    - Center an Element Horizontally

            - Using the margin Property

                Another positioning technique is to center a block element horizontally. 
                One way to do this is to set its margin to a value of auto.

                        margin: auto;

    - Gradual CSS Linear Gradient
            background: linear-gradient(gradient_direction, color 1, color 2, color 3, ...);

                    The first argument specifies the direction from which color transition starts - 
                    it can be stated as a degree, where 90deg makes a horizontal gradient (from left to right)
                     and 45deg makes a diagonal gradient (from bottom left to top right). The following 
                     arguments specify the order of colors used in the gradient.

            background: linear-gradient(90deg, red, yellow, rgb(204, 204, 255));

            - using the gradient to create strips using the repeating-linear-gradient()
                    Ex.
                            background: repeating-linear-gradient(
                                        45deg,
                                        yellow 0px,
                                        yellow 40px,
                                        black 40px,
                                        black 80px
                                        );
    - Transform
        (using)
                scale()
                    - to change the scale of an element
                            transform: scale(1);
                skewX()
                    - skew the selected elements along the X axis by a given degree
                            transform: skewX(-32deg);

                rotate()
                    - rotate the selected elements by a given degree

    - before and after 
            ::before and ::after pseudo-elements. 
                ::before creates a pseudo-element that is the first child of the selected element; 
                ::after creates a pseudo-element that is the last child of the selected element. 



    - @keyframes
            animation-name: sets the name of the animation, which is later used by @keyframes to tell 
                            CSS which rules go with which animations.

            animation-duration sets the length of time for the animation.


                    Ex. 
                         #anim {
                            animation-name: colorful;
                            animation-duration: 3s;
                        }

                        @keyframes colorful {
                            0% {
                                background-color: blue;
                        }
                            100% {
                                background-color: yellow;
                            }
                        }   


            - Animate Elements Continually Using an Infinite Animation Count

                    animation-iteration-count: 3;
                    run continuously by setting that value to infinite.

# Layout 
    
    # Flexbox 
        [controls the children of a parent box and turns the parent into a block]

            With flexbox, it's easy to center elements on the page and create 
            dynamic user interfaces that shrink and expand automatically.

                Note: The direction is based on the flex-direction property.
                (row) and same goes to the column 
            
            justify-items (main axis horizontally)
            align-items (cross axis vertically)
            
                - container

                    display: flexbox | inline-flex;
                    flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse;
                    flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse;
                    flex-flow: <‘flex-direction’> || <‘flex-wrap’>
                    justify-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around;
                    align-items: flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | stretch;
                    align-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | stretch;

                -  items/elements

                    order: <integer>;
                    flex-grow: <number>; /* default 0 */
                        -> only grows when there is available space to consume without affecting the siblings  of the child 

                    flex-shrink: <number>; /* default 1 */
                        -> only works until it gets the minimum size the element can get without the content overflowing

                    flex-basis: <length> | auto; /* default auto */
                        -> its just a width or height value that has priority over both tho 

                    flex: none | [ <'flex-grow'> <'flex-shrink'>? || <'flex-basis'> ]
                    align-self: auto | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | stretch;


                - flex Shorthand Property

                        Ex, 
                            
                        flex: 1 0 10px; 

                        will set the item(children) to 
                            flex-grow: 1;, 
                            flex-shrink: 0;,   
                            flex-basis: 10px;. [works like width or height based on the direction]

                - align-self
                    accepts the same values as align-items and will override any value set by the 
                    align-items property. [to the children by the parent]

                - min and max -content 

                    width: max-content;
                        Try's to get to the smallest size without needing to wrap

                    width: min-content;
                        Try's to get to the width of the longest single word

                - Ordering 
                    -> Flipping flex-direction
                            - row-reverse / column-reverse 

                    -> Other Mechanisms 
                        - order property [on individual children]
                        - flex-wrap
                        
                - z-index [works in flex without using position]
                
            Note : 
             -> Height and with are not hard rule's the flex algorithm usually doesn't break the rules to protect the content 

                items vs content 
                    -> content: means the group of children with in a flex/grid parent
                    -> items: how the children interact along the cross axis 
            -> When it comes between any layout modes positioned layouts always win! thats why as a general rule elements can't participate in multiple layout modes at once! [exception you can use relative and more or less sticky with flex]

    # Grid 
                Note: In CSS Grid, the parent element is referred to as 
                the container and its children are called items.


            - Size of Columns and Rows

                    fr: sets the column or row to a fraction of the available space,

                    auto: sets the column or row to the width or height of its content automatically,

                    %: adjusts the column or row to the percent width of its container.

                    Here's the code that generates the output in the preview:

            - Aligning items

                    - justify-self: (horizontally)
                        stretch | start | end | center
                            content of each item is located in a box which is referred to as a cell. 
                            You can align the content's position within its cell horizontally using 
                            the justify-self property on a grid item. By default, this property has a 
                            value of stretch,

                    - align-self: (vertically)
                        (same rule)


            - Aligning all of the items 
                    - justify-items
                    - align-items


            - Grid area template's (best way to use grid)
                    
                    Ex. 
                        grid-template-areas:
                            "header header header"
                            "advert content content"
                            "advert footer footer";

                    Note: Use grid-area Without Creating an Areas Template

                    grid-area: horizontal line to start at / vertical line to start at / horizontal line to end at / vertical line to end at;

                            item1 { 
                                grid-area: 1/1/2/4; 
                                }        

            - minmax Function
                used to limit the size of items when the grid container changes size. To do this you need 
                to specify the acceptable size range for your item. Here is an example:

                    Ex.
                            grid-template-columns: 100px minmax(50px, 200px);

                    In the code above, grid-template-columns is set to create two columns; 
                    the first is 100px wide, and the second has the minimum width of 50px and 
                    the maximum width of 200px.

            - auto-fill

                repeat function comes with an option called auto-fill. This allows you to automatically 
                insert as many rows or columns of your desired size as possible depending on the size of 
                the container. You can create flexible layouts when combining auto-fill with minmax, 
                
                            repeat(auto-fill, minmax(60px, 1fr));

                    Vs auto-fit

                    difference is that when the container's size exceeds the size of all the items combined, 
                    auto-fill keeps inserting empty rows or columns and pushes your items to the side, while 
                    auto-fit collapses those empty rows or columns and stretches your items to fit the size of 
                    the container.



            Steps -
                displayed: grid
                gap
                # setting a column up is good but just until you create a media query
                grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);

            # Use
                grid-template-columns
                grid-template-rows

                # with grid row, col span
                grid-row:
                grid-column:

            # or create and use 
                grid-template-areas: 
                    - create areas

                attach the areas with the nth-child of element

                    - create media query and create the layout as you see fit 
                    by embedding the grid-template-areas in it
  
# Tips For Layouts

    To Create the Vertical Layouts 
        ●  Use  <div>'s with  display  :  block  (most common) 
        ●  Use flexbox with  flex-direction  :  column 
        ●  Use CSS grid  with 1 column 

    To Create the Horizontal Layouts 
        ●  Use  <div>'s with  display  :  inline-block  (not recommended) 
        ●  Use flexbox with  flex-direction  :  row 
        ●  Use CSS grid with multiple columns 

    # Type of elements
        Block elements                          -> They take the whole line
        Inline-Block elements                   -> only takes space they need
        Inline                                 

# Responsive and Behavioral CSS

    # Responsive Design 
            
            [ is the idea that all clients will receive identical HTML files from the server but those HTML files will be flexible and will display differently on different devices.]

            Ex:
                Mobile devices have a 'device pixel ratio" it can be accessed in js with "window.devicePixelRatio"

        # What to do?
            - To make sure that our pages render correctly on mobile we need a meta tag:
                    
                    -> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />


            - Mobile-first vs Desktop-first 
                    Points to consider 
                        - its easier to add than take away 
                        - the approach must be consistent (don't use to start one and change it on a random element) 
                        - consider the traffic 
                    
                    # mostly mobile first is better but considering some cases its not bad to start with a desktop 

        - Media Query
            Tip: (min max works for both height and width)
                (media query's don't affect specificity)

                @media -> at-rule
                condition -> (min-width: 30em) || (max-width: 67em)
                {} -> style content for that particular size 

                    /* CSS */
                    @media (condition) {
                        /* Some CSS that'll run if the condition is met. */
                    }

            
            -> Boolean logic in media queries

                - You can use , and , or 

                @media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine) {
                    /* styles */
                }

                or 

                @media screen and (min-width: 600px) {
                    /* styles */
                }

                    screen -> is a “media type”. In this case, we're saying that the styles should only apply when displaying the site/app on a screen. 

            -> Preference-based media queries

                for color schemes:
                    @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
                        /* Dark-mode styles here */
                    }

                for motion:
                    @media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
                        /* Animations here */
                    }

            -> Orientation [not better then using min/max but not bad to have in the tool box]

                @media (orientation: portrait) {
                    /* Styles for windows that are taller than they are wide */
                }
                @media (orientation: landscape) {
                    /* Styles for windows that are wider than they are tall */
                }

        - Breakpoints 

            Here are the groups I've identified:
                0-550px — Mobile
                550-1100px — Tablet
                1100-1500px — Laptop
                1500+px — Desktop

            
            -> Implementing breakpoints

                    # Mobile First 

                        /* Default: Phones from 0px to 549px */
                        Then: 
                            create breakpoints for:
                                @media (min-width: 550px) {
                                    /* Tablets */
                                }
                                @media (min-width: 1100px) {
                                    /* Laptop */
                                }
                                @media (min-width: 1500px) {
                                    /* Desktop */
                                }



                    # Desktop First
                        /* Default: Desktop monitors, 1501px and up */
                        Then: 
                            create breakpoints for:
                                @media (max-width: 1500px) {
                                    /* Laptop */
                                }
                                @media (max-width: 1100px) {
                                    /* Tablets */
                                }
                                @media (max-width: 550px) {
                                    /* Phones */
                                }

        - Use a Retina Image for Higher Resolution Displays

            The simplest way to make your images properly appear on High-Resolution Displays,
            such as the MacBook Pros "retina display" is to define their width and height values 
            as only half of what the original file is. Here is an example of an image that is only 
            using half of the original height and width:

        - Make Typography Responsive
                Instead of using em or px to size text, you can use viewport units for responsive typography. 
                Viewport units, like percentages, are relative units, but they are based off different items. 
                Viewport units are relative to the viewport dimensions (width or height) of a device, and 
                percentages are relative to the size of the parent container element.

            The four different viewport units are: 

                    vw (viewport width): 10vw would be 10% of the viewport's width.
                    vh (viewport height): 3vh would be 3% of the viewport's height.
                    vmin (viewport minimum): 70vmin would be 70% of the viewport's smaller dimension (height or width).
                    vmax (viewport maximum): 100vmax would be 100% of the viewport's bigger dimension (height or width).


    # Behavioral CSS

# Units 
    - px

    - em [relative]
        It's a relative unit, equal to the font size of the current element.   

    - rem [should use]
        it's always relative to the root element, the <html> tag.All of the rems across your app will be taking their cues from that root HTML tag. By default, the HTML tag has a font size of 16px, so 1rem will be equal to 16px.

    - percentages
         used with width/height, as a way to consume a portion of the available space.
         example:
            parent [500*250]
                - child [50%*50%] -> (250*125)

# pseudo elements and class's
    Classes: target specific states
        :focus, :hover, :active . ...


    Elements: target sub-elements

        - The ::before Pseudo-element
                    Insert's some content before the content of an element.

        - The ::after Pseudo-element
                        Insert's some content after the content of an element.


        - ::first-line Pseudo-element
                Note: The ::first-line pseudo-element can only be applied to 
                block-level elements.

        - ::first-letter Pseudo-element
                Note: Same rule applies from the last 'Note'

        - :target 

        - :only-child , :first-child , :last-child, only-of-type

# Background Images 
    
    # Steps 
        create a parent and set the background img in css of the container 
        and use flex to position the child

    
        tip:
            use - to edit the blend on the background the backup bg-color 
            background-blend-mode

    # Hamburger Menu

        Creating your own Menu icon using 
            span 
                (
                    display: block;
                    width: 26px;
                    height: 2px;
                    background-color: var(--crl-primary);
                )

    # mixins 
        Steps: 
           - Create breakpoints 

                // 640px , 1024px, 1400px
                $breakpoints-up: (
                "medium": "40em",
                "large": "64em",
                "xlarge": "87.5em",
                );

                // 639px, 1023px. 1399px
                $breakpoints-down: (
                "small": "39.9375em",
                "medium": "63.9375em",
                "large": "84.4375em",
                );

            - Create mixins 

                @mixin breakpoint-up($size) {
                @media (min-width: map-get($breakpoints-up, $size)) {
                    @content;
                }
                }
                @mixin breakpoint-down($size) {
                @media (max-width: map-get($breakpoints-down, $size)) {
                    @content;
                }
                }

            - Create utility classes for the viewport 
                Ex, for visibility of menus (header styles)
                    // Visibility
                    .hide-for-mobile {
                    // hide for tablet and mobile devices
                    @include breakpoint-down(medium) {
                        display: none;
                    }
                    }

                    .hide-for-desktop {
                    // hide for desktop browsers
                    @include breakpoint-up(large) {
                        display: none;
                    }
                    }

            - Last step use the classes make your life easier :)

    # To Structure Html properly

        1-  The very first and important step is to go through the design properly.
        2-  The second step is to wireframe the design in form of HTML 
            block representation by the TLF (Top Left Flow) approach
                
                + The TLF approach works in the following manner:

                        First, divide the design horizontally.
                        Then divide the horizontal parts vertically.

                Note:
                    The proper way of using the TLF approach is to see whether the design block can 
                    be divided horizontally. If YES, divide. If NO, see whether the design block can 
                    be divided vertically. Repeat the same until all the design blocks have been covered.

                    Tip:
                        Always use comments ( Easy for us to remember in the future and to understand for others)
                        Make use of proper semantic HTML Tags.  *****
                                <article> 	Defines independent, self-contained content
                                <aside> 	Defines content aside from the page content
                                <details> 	Defines additional details that the user can view or hide
                                <figcaption> 	Defines a caption for a <figure> element
                                <figure> 	Specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc.
                                <footer> 	Defines a footer for a document or section

                                <time> 	Defines a date/time
                        Avoid using deprecated HTML Tags.
                        Validate your HTML code. 
                        Avoid using unwanted HTML Elements.

# Flow layout 
    Normal flow or flow layout is the awy that block and inline elemetns are displayed on A
    page before any changes are made to their layout

        # What are Block and inline elements

            1- Block
                    always takes up the full width available 
                    (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

                    footers, headers, main, section, div. form. nav, article, video...

            2 - Inline 
                    takes up as much width as necessary.

# Responsive Typography

        Instead of just using media query's to resize everything 

            Use- 
                viewport width and calc 

                Ex.
                    font-size: calc(16px + 2vw)


        - Use clamp

            font-size: clamp(28px, 16px+0.5vw, 40px)
                            min    preferred   max 

# Viewport Units 

    -> vh (viewport height) 
        : refers to the largest possible size 
    -> vw (viewport width)

    -> vmin [shorter dimension]
    -> vmax [longer dimension]

# Best Case Practice

    # Units 
        Typography -> use {rem}
        box model -> use {px}
        width/height -> based on the available space or fixed [chose accordingly]
        color -> use {hsl}
            -> make user the contrast ration is above the minimum value
